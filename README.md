New Apps from Original Ideas

First Project will be creating a network of Doctors, Patients and Pharmacies for generation, storage and fulfillment of electronic prescriptions, offline or online by authorized sellers.

The Doctor generates an ePrescription using our web based tool using a template online, signs it digitally(PDF digital signature) and assigns it to a  pharmacy for fulfillment and patient for future reference. The document is encrypted for privacy.
The patient can view, delete or request for fulfillment again with the doctor's advice.
The pharmacist views the ePrescription and fulfills it for the patient.
The entire lifecycle of the prescription is thus maintained and available with three parties. Also it is to provide convience to patients to carry and show any prescription to the pharmacist with a smartphone or tablet.

This was created at AngelHack Spring Bangalore 2014. The code is not yet ready for public view. Also the concept belongs to Jigisha Aryya ONLY. No Company or individual(s) has the permission to copy or implement our idea in any form without permission.
